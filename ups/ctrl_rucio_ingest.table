# List EUPS dependencies of this package here
# - Common third-party packages (boost, python, doxygen) and low-level
#   LSST packages can be assumed to be recursively included by
#   LSST packages such as utils or daf_base.
# - Any package whose API is used should be listed explicitly
#   rather than assuming it will be included recursively.
# - The base package provides lsstimport. You can remove this explicit
#   dependency if this package also declares higher-level dependencies.
# - The utils package supports unit tests. This dependency can be removed
#   if the package doesn't directly use its APIs in tests.
